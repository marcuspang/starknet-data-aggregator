Teresa is a transparent data aggregator platform that leverages Starknet's computation capabilities to perform aggregation on-chain. Existing platforms that aggregate data do so in a centralised manner. Aggregation is usually done off-chain, where the specifics are not available to the user. As such, Teresa tackles this issue by performing this computation on-chain and exposing this logic to the user.

## Running The Project
