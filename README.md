## Project Description
Teresa is a transparent data aggregator paltform that leverage Starnet's computation  capabilities to perform aggregation on-chain. Existing platforms that aggregate data do so in a centralised manner. Aggregation is usually done off-chain, where the specifics are not available to the user. As such, Teresa tackles this issue by performing this computation on-chain and exposing this logic to the user.


The process of the project:
1. Insert a NFT collection address.
2. it will then look for the collection. 
3. user can then check for its stats like floor price , 24 hour volume, wallet interacted and many more. 
4. User can then see all the computation transparently.


## Running the Project
